# Deformation-estimation-for-ExMicroscopy-Image
Following Abbe's diffraction limit, the resolution of optical microscopy is limited to 200 nm.  This resolution is not enough for modern biologists to observe the intracellular phenomenon or subcellular structure. Expansion microscopy(ExM) solves this problem by expanding biological samples through the polymer system, which provides investigators higher resolution without using specialized equipment. Its expansion procedure should be isotropic to avoid structure deformation. Therefore the extent of structure deformation represent the quality of ExM.To calcualte it, a deformation vector field between two images(Pre and Post-ExM) is generated via a nonrigid registration process,"B-spline registration". Then, the root-mean-square (RMS) error of feature on Post_ExM images is computed to quantity the consistency in length varying of specific structures before and after ExM. Here, we built a tool to carry on above quantifications based on  T.J. Chozinski et.al 's method. This tool warp Elastix and Pyelastix 

To quantify the isotropy of ExM, we calculated the deformation vector field between the images via a nonrigid registration process (fig. S3). From this vector field, we quantified the root-mean-square (RMS) error of feature measurements post-ExM.
